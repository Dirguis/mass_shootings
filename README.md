# mass_shootings

This repo is focused on generating an HTML map showing the location of all the mass shootings that occurred in the US since 1982, as compiled by the magazine MotherJones. The data and explanation of the data can be found [here](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/).

The data has been slightly pre-processed and is available is the csv file "MJ_processed_ds.csv". Once cloned, you can run the HTML file navigating to the folder and executing in the terminal the command:
`python -m http.server 8000`

You can then open your browser and see the map, at the address: http://0.0.0.0:8000/
